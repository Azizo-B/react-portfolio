I also built a frontend annotation tool that allowed users to provide feedback directly on the AI's extracted bounding boxes, which was used to further train the AI and improve its accuracy. Additionally, I implemented a system to classify processed invoices into the correct account numbers. The application was deployed on Google Cloud, ensuring scalability and cost efficiency, while the MLOps pipeline I developed created a continuous feedback loop to improve system performance over time."
